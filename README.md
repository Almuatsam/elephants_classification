# Elephants Binary Classification using Deep Learning

This notebook implements a binary image classification solution for detecting African and Asian elephants using images. We'll compare three different models:
1. Basic CNN model
2. Improved CNN with BatchNormalization
3. Pre-trained ResNet50 model


The dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivmankar/asian-vs-african-elephant-image-classification
The dataset contains elephants images classified as either African or Asian.
